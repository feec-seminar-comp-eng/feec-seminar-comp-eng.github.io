[IA382](https://www.cpg.feec.unicamp.br/cpg/lista/caderno_horario_show.php?id=1888) is a 02 credits online graduate seminar class offered by the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering ([FEEC](https://www.fee.unicamp.br/)) at the University of Campinas ([UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/)), to discuss state-of-art topics in the broad field of Computer Engineering.

Students are exposed to top-tier talks and panel conversations by national and international experts from academia and industry.

The students are expected to write up a summary and answer some key aspects of each seminar, in addition to other discussion and learning activities.

The seminar is open to participation and streamed online through the [Youtube channel of FEEC](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChptcdqmzNLQ8Oe03DEjIDQ).


## History

The IA382 seminar class in 1S/2024 will be coordinated by [Prof. Christian Esteve Rothenberg](https://www.dca.fee.unicamp.br/~chesteve/) and will take place every Thursday from 1pm to 2pm and will be completely online.


Students will be asked to write a summary and answer some key aspects of each seminar. In addition, the students will learn good practices on identifying the relevant literature of the seminar topics. Along this process, AI tools like ChatGPT will be also explored.

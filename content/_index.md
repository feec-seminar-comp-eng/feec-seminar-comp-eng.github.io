[IA382](https://www.cpg.feec.unicamp.br/cpg/lista/caderno_horario_show.php?id=1888) is a 02 credits seminar class offered by the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering ([FEEC](https://www.fee.unicamp.br/)) at the University of Campinas ([UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/)), with the objective to discuss state-of-art topics in the broad field of Computer Engineering.

Undergraduate and graduate students will be exposed to top-tier talks and panel conversations by national and international experts from academia and industry.

The students are expected to writeup a summary and answer some key aspects of each seminar, in addition to other discussion and learning activities.

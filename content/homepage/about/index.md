## History

Conceived by [Prof. Christian Esteve Rothenberg](https://www.dca.fee.unicamp.br/~chesteve/), the Seminar of Computer Engineering class started in the first semester of 2023 under the FEEC/UNICAMP graduate class code IA377. Therefore, you may find some references to IA377 in past messages, YouTube videos, and old versions of the Website (e.g. https://ia377-feec-unicamp.github.io/ ).

In the first semester of 2024, the new class code IA382 was assigned corresponding to the 100% remote, online format of the English-based seminar class offering.

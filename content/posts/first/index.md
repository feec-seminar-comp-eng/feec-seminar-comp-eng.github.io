Harvey Newman received the Sc.D. degree from MIT in 1974. From 1973 to 1974, he co-led the team that discovered fourth quark flavor known as charm. He co-led the MARK J Collaboration that discovered the gluon, the carrier of the strong force in 1979. Since 1982, he has been a Faculty Member with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he is currently the Marvin L. Goldberger Professor of physics. He has been leading a role in originating, developing, and operating state of the art international networks and collaborative systems serving the high energy and nuclear physics communities since 1982. He served on the IETF and the Technical Advisory Group that led to the NSFNet from 1985 to 1986, originated the worldwide LHC Computing Model in 1996, and has been leading the science and network engineering teams defining the state of the art in long distance data transfers since 2002. Since 1994, he has been a member of CMS that discovered the Higgs boson at LHC in 2012.

## Abstract
6G will enable a “cyber-physical continuum”, where the network provides intelligence, limitless connectivity, and full synchronization of the physical and digital worlds. 

Vast amounts of sensors embedded in the physical world send data to update digital representations in real time. It becomes possible to trace back and analyze events, observe, and act in real-time, as well as to simulate, predict, and program future actions. A key component for that vision are “Digital Twins”.​

Network digital twins (NDT) are digital representations of real telecommunication networks, that should be synchronized with their real counterparts at an arbitrary frequency. Tailoring their requirements towards individual use cases can significantly increase their potential to create value in telecommunications processes. ​

In this presentation we will look into what digital twins are, technologies for implementing them (e.g., simulation, machine learning), and key use cases in telecom.​

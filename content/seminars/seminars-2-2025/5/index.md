## Abstract

Network operators who manage private cloud infrastructure for hosting telecoms workloads and applications must continuously scale-up, optimise and adapt their platform to meet the needs of diverse “tenants” hosted on such infrastructure. All this must be done with as much operational efficiency as possible while not compromising performance, security and service guarantees. This talk will cover 5 key pillars of ongoing telco cloud evolution which feed into this problem space: cloud native workloads & automation, hardware heterogeneity, towards the edge, energy efficiency, and secure computing. We will also discuss the role of AI and network observability within these domains.

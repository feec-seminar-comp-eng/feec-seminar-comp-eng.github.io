Ex-Cisco Fellow & Ex-Huawei Intelligent Operations Management CTO, Benoit created his own consulting "Everything OPS" company focusing on his passion: all aspects of the Autonomous Driving Networks vision. Benoit has been focusing on configuration management, network automation, data-model driven management. The latest focus is on data collection, service assurance, with the model-driven telemetry for closed loop automation, on digital map, intent, and knowledge graph and a renewed interest for IPIFX as building blocks to reduce the cost of managing networks. Benoit is currently the co-chair for the IETF Operations & Management Area (OPSAWG) and Network Management Operations (NMOP) working groups. Served a 6 years term as IETF Operational and Management Area Director, exclusively focused on the YANG models standardization throughout the industry, a labor-intensive but necessary step for the automatic configuration (via NETCONF, RESTCONF, YANG-Push) required in today Software Defined Network world. Contributor to the IETF with 43 RFCs and more IETF drafts. Benoit also published two books: Network Programmability with YANG: "The Structure of Network Automation with YANG, NETCONF, RESTCONF, and gNMI" and "Network management: Accounting and Performance Strategies.

## Abstract

The success of the Internet is undeniable, but so are its limitations. Over the past two decades, the research community has responded with clean-slate redesigns, proposing innovative architectures focused on issues like security and information dissemination, among others. Unfortunately, these efforts have had limited impact on the commercial Internet, if any. The reason is that the Internet architecture is deeply entrenched, making a complete replacement elusive.

In this talk, I will argue that a successful approach to evolving the Internet requires three key ingredients. It should (1) be backwards compatible with the current Internet, (2) evolve from the existing architecture, and (3) allow new architectures to reach their full potential. Recently, the community introduced an overlay-based approach for an Extensible Internet. I believe this is a clear step in the right direction: it is backwards-compatible, does not require replacing the current Internet infrastructure, and is deployable today. However, I contend that this approach is not fully adequate as it lacks the third requirement, which I deem crucial for new architectures to gain a foothold and grow. As an alternative, in the talk I will advocate for a translation-based approach and present my rationale on how it may enable effective Internet evolution by meeting the three requirements above. This presentation will expand on my talk at HotNets this past November.

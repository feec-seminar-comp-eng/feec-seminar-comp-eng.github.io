## Abstract

Electromagnetic (EM) sensing is rapidly emerging as a compelling alternative to traditional visual and optical methods in real-time detection, offering advantages in sensitivity, selectivity, and resilience in harsh environments or complex sensing medium. In this talk, I will present our research at the Calgary Sensor Lab, where we design novel RF and microwave circuits for smart, application-specific sensors that push beyond conventional sensing paradigms. Our work spans transdisciplinary collaborations in healthcare, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. I will highlight recent advances in passive and battery-less microwave sensors for real-time nutrient monitoring, implant surface characterization, and microplastic contamination detection. These systems are designed to operate without direct contact or visual access, leveraging resonant electromagnetic structures to probe material properties with high fidelity. To address real-world deployment constraints, we integrate machine learning, embedded systems, and edge computing into our hardware platforms, enabling robust, multivariable sensing in compact, cost-effective formats. The result is a new class of EM-based sensors that are not only sensitive and selective, but also adaptive and field-deployable. This talk will reflect on the broader vision: to reimagine how we detect, monitor, and understand physical and biological phenomena without always needing to see them.

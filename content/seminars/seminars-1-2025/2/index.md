## Abstract

Cloud Gaming and Augmented/Extended Reality (AR/XR) are reshaping interactive digital experiences, requiring ultra-low latency, high throughput, and reliable connectivity to deliver real-time responsiveness and immersive QoE. Their high interactivity makes them sensitive to even minor delays, often leading to motion or cybersickness. Unlike traditional applications, CG/AR traffic is dynamic, with frequently changing IPs and ports, rendering static identification methods ineffective. In this talk, we discuss the unique traffic patterns of CG and AR, why they must be prioritized for real-time services, and how ML-based traffic classification can help manage them efficiently. We also explore current QoS/QoE evaluation methods, techniques for performance improvement, and highlight open research challenges in managing CG/AR traffic over shared networks.

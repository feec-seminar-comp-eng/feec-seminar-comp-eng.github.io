## Abstract

In this seminar, we will explore quantum algorithms from the perspective of Computer Engineering, covering both their theoretical foundations and the practical challenges of implementation across different quantum computing paradigms. We will discuss how quantum algorithms represent a fundamental shift from the classical computational model, requiring new approaches to abstraction, data encoding, compilation, and execution on qubit-based architectures. The seminar will analyze the main classes of quantum algorithms — including those focused on simulation, optimization, machine learning, and cryptography — and their potential applications in the NISQ era. The presentation will also highlight the role of development tools and emerging languages in advancing quantum software engineering, as well as reflect on the opportunities available to engineers looking to work at this technological frontier.

## Bio

Professor Anderson Santos holds a degree in Computer Engineering from the Military Institute of Engineering (IME). During his undergraduate studies, he was a Scientific Initiation fellow at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA), working in the field of Dynamical Systems. He earned his Ph.D. in Computational Modeling from the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC), where he developed a non-deterministic model for detecting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. At IME, he teaches Quantum Computing and conducts research in this field and in Cybernetics. At Venturus Technology Innovation Center, he works as a Researcher in Quantum Computing, as part of the Emerging Technologies team. His primary research interests include Quantum Computing and Cybernetics.

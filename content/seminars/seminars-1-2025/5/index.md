## Abstract
The next generation of mobile communications is expected to revolutionize connectivity through the integration of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into its core architecture. This talk explores the concept of an AI-native 6G system, highlighting the symbiotic relationship between AI and 6G mobile networks. The architecture of AI-native 6G systems is characterized by distributed AI processing, edge intelligence, and the use of machine learning algorithms for (non/near-) real-time decision-making. These features support the autonomous operation of the mobile network elements. Specifically, the talk introduces the basic principles, technical challenges and research opportunities associated with developing AI-native 6G systems. Furthermore, the talk will provide an overview of the DESIRE6G system, an AI-native 6G system architecture, emphasizing its foundational principles and technical innovations by introducing related dynamic resource management approaches.

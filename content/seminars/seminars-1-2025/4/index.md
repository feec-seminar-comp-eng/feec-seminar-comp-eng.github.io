## Abstract

The Vera Rubin Observatory, the world’s largest optical telescope, presents a set of operational requirements that have created numerous challenges across all involved domains—from architecture to logistics, from materials to computer networks. For the telecommunications and networking teams, requirements such as high bandwidth, high availability, full redundancy, per-second telemetry, among others, have driven the adoption of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), P4 programming, per-packet telemetry, and the use of optical spectrum over submarine cables. This presentation will explore the operational workflow of the Vera Rubin Observatory and delve into the process and challenges of building a network of such complexity, with a focus on SDN, telemetry, and innovation.

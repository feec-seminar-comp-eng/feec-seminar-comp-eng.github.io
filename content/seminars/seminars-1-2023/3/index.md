**Abstract** 

This talk is about Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), in specific the near-Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller (near-RT RIC). Besides presenting an architectural overview of the O-RAN architecture focusing on the near-RT RIC, the talk aims to elaborate on the internal aspects of the design, implementation and testing of the SD-RAN trial in Berlin, specifically describing the ONF SD-RAN project. The goal is to provide an overview of the O-RAN, the SD-RAN trial, the internal aspects of the ONF SD-RAN project, and the integration challenges.

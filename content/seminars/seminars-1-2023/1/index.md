**Abstract** 

Following the state of the art is paramount for sound and impact scientific practices
informed strategic R&D decisions. This seminar seeks two main contributions:
(i) providing a 10,000 foot view of 10 selected hot topics in networking, and (ii) Overview of recent practices in scientific events (e.g. Digitalization, Submission deadlines revisited, Open Science, Artifact Review Badging). 

The 10 selected hot topics are as follows:

* Intent-Based Networking (IBN)
* Zero-Touch Management (ZTM)
* Digital Twins (Networking for Digital Twins & Network Digital Twins)
* Metaverse
* Blockchain Networking
* AI/ML (Network protocols meet AI/ML, Machine Learning for Networking)
* High precision networking 
* Quantum Communications & Computing
* 6G (Beyond 5G)
* OpenRAN

Christian Rodolfo Esteve Rothenberg, Associate Professor, University of Campinas (Unicamp)

Since August 2013, Christian Esteve Rothenberg is Head of the Information & Networking Technologies Research & Innovation Group (INTRIG) and Associate Professor at University of Campinas (UNICAMP), where he received his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2010.
From 2010 to 2013, he worked as Senior Research Scientist in the areas of IP systems and networking at CPqD R&D Center in Telecommunications, Campinas, Brazil.
During his PhD, he worked on probabilistic data structures applied to packet forwarding in content-centric networks, was a visiting researcher (2008) at Ericsson Research Nomadic Lab, Jorvas, Finland.
He holds the Telecommunication Engineering degree from the Technical University of Madrid (ETSIT - UPM), Spain, and the M.Sc. (Dipl. Ing.) degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the Technical University of Darmstadt (TUD), Germany, 2006. During his master thesis at Deutsche Telekom he worked on IMS-based fixed mobile convergence and mobility management, and was engaged in R&D activities on converged access networks (ScaleNet) and self-optimizing radio access networks. He was an Open Networking Foundation (ONF) Research Associate, co-chair of the IEEE SDN Outreach Committee initiative, and member of the CPQD Innovation Committee.
Christian has contributed to 07 international patents, co-authored three books, and over 200 scientific publications, including top-tier scientific journals and networking conferences such as SIGCOMM and INFOCOM, altogether featuring 10 000+ citations (h-index: 30+, i10-index: 70+). In 2020, Christian was included in the  top-cited career-long impact scientists according to PLoS Biol 18(10).

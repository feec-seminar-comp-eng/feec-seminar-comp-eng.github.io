## Abstract

The slowdown of Moore’s Law, the end of Dennard’s scaling, and the rapid adoption of high-bandwidth links is creating new challenges when building high-performance end-host network stacks and when dealing with network function virtualization. Recognising this trend, the research community has recently explored ways to help host processing through offloads.In this talk, I will discuss opportunities and challenges when designing application offloads and when boosting network functions virtualization performance. In particular, I will focus on two specific axis of the problem space: re-designing protocols and primitives for NIC offloads as well as enhancing packet-processing capabilities through compiler-driven approaches.

Gianni Antichi is an Associate Professor at [Dipartimento Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria of Politecnico di Milano (Italy)](https://www.deib.polimi.it/ita/home) and Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) at the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science of Queen Mary University of London (United Kindgom). His research interests sit at the intersection of networks and systems and the goal is to develop hardware/software co-designs to improve performance and efficiency of end-host applications as well as packet-processing programs. He received a PhD in Information Engineering from the University of Pisa (Italy). His awards include the best paper at ACM SIGCOMM 2017, the ACM SOSR system 2019, the EPSRC New Investigator and the Facebook Networking Systems Research RFP in 2020.

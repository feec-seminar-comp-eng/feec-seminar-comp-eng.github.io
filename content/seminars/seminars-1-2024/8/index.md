## Abstract

This talk will give an overview of video streaming technologies over telecommunication networks, while also taking the important evolution towards network softwarizaton into account. The importance and the opportunities provided by volumetric media delivery will be outlined by means of several examples. The most appropriate approach for volumetric media delivery and the various challenges and techniques will be highlighted next. Finally an overview of research challenges and opportunities will be presented to stimulate further research.

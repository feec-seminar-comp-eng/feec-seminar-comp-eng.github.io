## Abstract

Medical imaging is an essential tool for diagnostics and health management. Wait times for these exams are long and increasing worldwide. Long wait times adversely impact healthcare by delaying subsequent health services, leading to late diagnosis, poorer patient outcomes, and increased costs to individuals and the healthcare system. According to the 2019 "The Value of Radiology report," the direct annual costs to the Canadian economy are> $2B/year. In this presentation, Dr. Roberto Souza, Assistant professor at the University of Calgary, will present how artificial intelligence models of medical image reconstruction, segmentation, and classification can be used to revolutionize imaging diagnostics by making exams faster and providing tools to expedite image analysis and support clinical decisions.

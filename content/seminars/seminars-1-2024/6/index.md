## Abstract
Generative AI is changing the way we interact with technology. This talk aims to provide a brief historical introduction of multimodal sequence models, and equip you with the practical knowledge to understand and use generative AI models in your own work. Talking to machines is not the same as talking to humans. We'll explore effective techniques for instructing, using demonstrations, fine-tuning, and building systems/agents, while also considering potential biases and limitations.

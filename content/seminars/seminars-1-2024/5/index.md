## Abstract

This talk will discuss recent developments on distributed computing and wireless communications to enable time-sensitive systems and applications, such as virtualized industrial automation, mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, and new immersive user experiences. The talk will discuss requirements for accurate time and deterministic wireless connectivity to leverage virtualized computing for advanced learning capabilities in real-time with high reliability. The talk will also provide an overview of the advances in Wi-Fi, 5G and support for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) capabilities that enable deterministic low latency. We will conclude with industry ecosystem activities, open challenges, and future research directions.

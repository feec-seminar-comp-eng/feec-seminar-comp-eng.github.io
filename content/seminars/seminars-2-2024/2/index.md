## Abstract
General intelligence is a branch of AI research that aims to create machines capable of understanding and learning any intellectual task that a human can. The goal of developing AGI chips is to support the advancement of artificial general intelligence, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the field of AI. In this lecture, the vision, hardware technology, and philosophy of AGI chip development are covered. The roadmap for AGI development, along with the ethical and design challenges for AGI chip development, will be presented. The limitations of weak AI, and the practical challenges that come with increased on-chip and on-board system design, along with alogrithmic, and systems thinking approaches, will be discussed.

## Abstract
We are currently experiencing a paradigm shift in the field of artificial intelligence, where with every new version of a large language model, tasks that once seemed far from being solved are now being addressed. However, due to the vast amount of data and computation required, the cost to develop and serve these general-purpose AIs is high. On the other hand, recent results show that specialization in domains and languages can lead to an increase in the quality of predictions at lower training and inference costs. In this talk, we will examine empirical results that exemplify this tension between generalist models, which aim to learn universal knowledge, and specialists, which focus on obtaining localized knowledge. Finally, we will discuss the future of artificial intelligence, particularly in Brazil.

Rodrigo Nogueira is the founder and CEO of Maritaca AI, a company specializing in the development of specialized LLMs in Brazil. He was a pioneer in the use of Transformers in search systems and co-author of the book "Pretrained Transformers for Text Ranking." Rodrigo holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from New York University (NYU), having been mentored by the renowned Professor Kyunghyun Cho. Throughout his career, Nogueira has made contributions to the fields of Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing through the creation of models such as BERTimbau, doc2query, monoT5, and more recently, the Sabi√° 1, 2 and 3 models, which are specialized LLMs in Brazil.

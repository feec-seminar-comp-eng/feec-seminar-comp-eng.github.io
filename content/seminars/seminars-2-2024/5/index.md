## Abstract
Multi-objective optimization refers to solving problems having two or more (often conflicting) objectives at the same time. Such problems are ill-defined and their solution is not a single solution but instead, a set of them, which represent the best possible trade-offs among the objectives. Evolutionary algorithms are particularly suitable for solving multi-objective problems because they are population-based, and require little domain-specific information to conduct the search. Due to these advantages, the development of the so-called multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) has significantly increased in the last 15 years. In this talk, we will provide a general overview of the field, including the main algorithms in current use as well as some of the many applications of them.

Carlos Artemio Coello Coello received a PhD in Computer Science from Tulane University (USA) in 1996. His research has mainly focused on the design of new multi-objective optimization algorithms based on bio-inspired metaheuristics (e.g., evolutionary algorithms), which is an area in which he has made pioneering contributions. He has received several awards, including the National Research Award (in 2007) from the Mexican Academy of Science and the 2012 National Medal of Science in Physics, Mathematics and Natural Sciences from Mexico's presidency, the 2013 IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award, the 2016 The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) Award in “Engineering Sciences”, and the 2021 IEEE Computational Intelligence Society Evolutionary Computation Pioneer Award. Since January 2011, he is an IEEE Fellow. He is currently the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation. He is Full Professor with distinction (Investigador Cinvestav 3F) at the Computer Science Department of CINVESTAV-IPN in Mexico City, Mexico.

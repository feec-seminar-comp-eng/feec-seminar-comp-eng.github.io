Unfortunately, the dominant solutions available today are either fast-yet-dumb or slow-but-intelligent. Data-plane devices (e.g., switches and NICs) can react in nanoseconds to network conditions; however, they are designed for routing packets and have a constrained programming model (e.g., match-action tables or MATs). Conversely, control-plane servers can make complicated data-driven (AI-based) decisions, yet the round trip between the controller and the device fundamentally limits their reaction speed.\nIn this talk, I will show how my research helps bridge this gap between speed, flexibility, and intelligence. I will present a new data-plane architecture (Taurus) and a declarative programming framework (Homunculus) that, for the first time, allows network operators to execute per-packet data-driven decisions directly within the data-plane device at line rate. I will first focus on the design of Taurus and the accompanying parallel-patterns abstraction (MapReduce), which supports data parallelism to efficiently execute common ML models (e.g., DNNs and SVMs). I will then demonstrate how, using training data, objectives, and constraints as inputs, Homunculus automatically converts the operator’s high-level policies into an efficient ML model to execute on the underlying data-plane device (e.g., Taurus). I will conclude with an overview of my broader research vision and future plans for realizing the full potential of fast, flexible, and intelligent next-generation networks (and systems).\nBio # Muhammad Shahbaz is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Michigan.

Unlike traditional applications, CG/AR traffic is dynamic, with frequently changing IPs and ports, rendering static identification methods ineffective. In this talk, we discuss the unique traffic patterns of CG and AR, why they must be prioritized for real-time services, and how ML-based traffic classification can help manage them efficiently.

Over the past two decades, the research community has responded with clean-slate redesigns, proposing innovative architectures focused on issues like security and information dissemination, among others. Unfortunately, these efforts have had limited impact on the commercial Internet, if any. The reason is that the Internet architecture is deeply entrenched, making a complete replacement elusive.\nIn this talk, I will argue that a successful approach to evolving the Internet requires three key ingredients. It should (1) be backwards compatible with the current Internet, (2) evolve from the existing architecture, and (3) allow new architectures to reach their full potential. Recently, the community introduced an overlay-based approach for an Extensible Internet. I believe this is a clear step in the right direction: it is backwards-compatible, does not require replacing the current Internet infrastructure, and is deployable today. However, I contend that this approach is not fully adequate as it lacks the third requirement, which I deem crucial for new architectures to gain a foothold and grow. As an alternative, in the talk I will advocate for a translation-based approach and present my rationale on how it may enable effective Internet evolution by meeting the three requirements above. This presentation will expand on my talk at HotNets this past November.\nBio # Fernando Ramos is an Associate Professor at Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon, where he coordinates the Master\u0026rsquo;s Programme in Telecommunications and Informatics Engineering.

However, the architecture of the current wireless networks (for example, 5G or IoT) is often fixed, and the optimization tasks are defined to cope with specific and identified challenges and services. Hence, the prevailing manual and predetermined optimization and configuration tasks are no longer appropriate for future networks. Furthermore, we are increasingly dealing with new kinds of networks - like networks of drones, the Internet of Everything, intelligent transportation systems - which bring in several new challenges related to network responsiveness and scalability. We are working on resolving such issues by proposing a framework inspired by theories and tools borrowed from complex systems science, focusing on the impact of network topology on the system\u0026rsquo;s (i) information representation and transfer, (ii) robustness, and (iii) self-synchronisation capabilities.\nBio of Nicola Marchetti # Dr. Nicola Marchetti is a Professor at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, where he is the Head of the EE Engineering department.

Circuits and Systems (CAS), which are the base for any system, can bring the needed functionalities and performances for reaching eco-friendly, circular and practical solutions. The IoT active connections in agriculture (as an example in Europe) are exponentially increasing, proving that Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA or Precision/Smart Agriculture) is a very fast-growing research field, where more controlled quality production, water use optimisation, and a lower spreading of pesticides and fertilisers are some key issues, serving the improvement of food quality, but also helping the respect of agriculture for the environment. To reach these targets, electronics are the perfect tool for interfacing the data sources, extracting and processing the data, and obtaining the needed information along the whole food chain: from the farmer and the professional stakeholders to the consumers. In the Distinguished Lecture, an overview of electronics for CSA will be presented, analysing the possible solutions that can bring important innovations, advancing the actual strategies based on remote or indirect measurements by instead of in-place measuring the plant and soil parameters (a.k.a. Let the Plants do The Talking), associated with more standard information derived from environmental conditions. This new and disruptive technology, related to Wearable Sensors for Plants, the World Economic Forum has recently identified it as one of the “Top five technologies about to change the world”, indicating it as one of the key solutions to increase food production by 70% by 2050 to be able to feed the world population. Application scenarios for crop monitoring, water control, information communication and decision support will be presented. In particular, it will be analysed technologies for reaching the needed levels of low power and low cost and the efficient ones to be applied to AgriFood at the global scale, also supporting food security and sustainability.\nBio of Danilo Demarchi # Danilo Demarchi is Full Professor at Politecnico di Torino, Department of Electronics and Telecommunications.

It allows a much better level of control and manageability, compared to existing transport approaches using UDP or TCP. For best behaviour and performance, packet trimming has to be well matched to the application data format. Packet trimming needs support at the server/sender, in the network edge, and at the client to achieve this best performance. The approach taken for each of these is presented. We have found that using trimming is good for fixed bandwidths, and is highly adaptable to dynamic bandwidth changes. As such, it is ideal for Beyond 5G and 6G scenarios, where trimming functions can be placed at the edge.\nBio of Stuart Clayman # Stuart Clayman received his PhD in Computer Science from University College London in 1994.

Such problems are ill-defined and their solution is not a single solution but instead, a set of them, which represent the best possible trade-offs among the objectives. Evolutionary algorithms are particularly suitable for solving multi-objective problems because they are population-based, and require little domain-specific information to conduct the search. Due to these advantages, the development of the so-called multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) has significantly increased in the last 15 years. In this talk, we will provide a general overview of the field, including the main algorithms in current use as well as some of the many applications of them.\nBio of Carlos Artemio Coello Coello # Carlos Artemio Coello Coello received a PhD in Computer Science from Tulane University (USA) in 1996.

Notable examples include alternative waveforms, massive multiple-input multiple-output signaling, non-orthogonal multiple access, joint communications and sensing, AI-empowered systems, and so on. In this context, 6G wireless networks will inevitably require a rethinking of wireless communication systems and technologies, particularly at the physical layer, since the cellular industry reached another critical milestone with the development of 5G wireless networks with diverse applications. Within this perspective, first, this talk aims to shed light on the most recent developments in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communication towards 6G and beyond wireless networks by discussing promising candidates for future research and development. Specifically, we emphasize different RIS architectures and emerging RIS use cases. Second, taking RIS-based radio frequency chain-free transmitters one step further, we put forward the paradigm of noise-driven communication. We discuss the potential of noise-driven communication systems for three purposes: low/zero-signal-power transmission by indexing resistors or other noise sources according to information bits, noise-alike waveform/modulation design for improved communication efficiency, and unconditionally secure key generation using noise-based loops.\nBio of Ertuğrul Başar # Prof. Ertuğrul Başar received his Ph.D. degree from Istanbul Technical University in 2013.

A major technical breakthrough and enabler in multimedia systems research and of industrial networked multimedia services certainly was the HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) technique. This resulted in the standardization of MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH) which, together with HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), is widely used for multimedia delivery in today’s networks. Existing challenges in multimedia systems research deal with the trade-off between (i) the ever-increasing content complexity, (ii) various requirements with respect to time (most importantly, latency), and (iii) quality of experience (QoE). Optimizing towards one aspect usually negatively impacts at least one of the other two aspects if not both.\nThis situation sets the stage for our research work in the ATHENA Christian Doppler (CD) Laboratory (Adaptive Streaming over HTTP and Emerging Networked Multimedia Services; https://athena.itec.aau.at/), jointly funded by public sources and industry.\nIn this talk, we will present selected novel approaches and research results of the first year of the ATHENA CD Lab’s operation. We will highlight HAS-related research on (i) multimedia content provisioning (machine learning for video encoding); (ii) multimedia content delivery (support of edge processing and virtualized network functions for video networking); (iii) multimedia content consumption and end-to-end aspects (player-triggered segment retransmissions to improve video playout quality); and (iv) novel QoE investigations (adaptive point cloud streaming).

Additionally, the architecture of new mobile generations must be completely standardized before its commercial release. 5G standardization for its first commercial release was ready in 2020, exactly ten years before the commercial deployment of 4G. Similarly, nowadays, the race for the 6G wireless networks that will be operational in 2030 has already started. To fulfill its potential in the upcoming decade, 6G will undoubtedly require an architectural orchestration based on the amalgamation of existing solutions and innovative technologies. The complex 6G\u0026rsquo;s use cases will fundamentally require a massive orchestration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning embedded in the fronthaul/backhaul architecture. The use cases will need advanced techniques to enable the future wireless network to be human-centric, ensuring enhanced quality of experience (QoE) for most applications. For such achievement, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Society 5.0 framework are paramount for building a 6G intelligent network that can contribute to fostering a better life on Earth for all beyond 2030, along with ethical engineering readiness for SDG (EESDG). This lecture covers a holistic overview of 6G R\u0026amp;D, challenges, and innovation.\nBio\n*Paulo Sergio Rufino Henrique (Aarhus University / CGC / França).* Paulo Sergio Rufino Henrique, engenheiro elétrico, pós-graduado em Wireless Communications em Londres, estudante de doutorado em 6G na Aarhus University na Dinamarca, autor, palestrante e gerente de integração na Spideo em Paris, França.

As redes quânticas permitem novos recursos aos sistemas de comunicação, possibilitando que as partes gerem entrelaçamento quântico de longa distância, para atender a diferentes tarefas, incluindo computação quântica distribuída, sensoriamento de alta precisão, computação quântica sobre dados cifrados, segurança em lances privados e a geração de chaves secretas compartilhadas entre várias partes, cuja segurança depende essencialmente das leis da física. No entanto, os sinais quânticos são frágeis e, em geral, não podem ser copiados ou amplificados. Para viabilizar o uso amplo e o desenvolvimento de aplicações, é essencial desenvolver métodos que permitam que os protocolos quânticos se conectem à implementação de hardware subjacente de forma transparente e tomem decisões rápidas e reativas para gerar entrelaçamento na rede para mitigar os tempos de vida limitados dos qubits. Arquiteturas para redes quânticas em grande escala estão em desenvolvimento, paralelamente ao trabalho teórico e experimental em camadas físicas, gerenciamento de erros em camadas inferiores e tecnologias de conexão.
